## Introduction
Hi, this is my first github project to help me learn how to user github
This repository contains basic files like:

  ## What is Github?
  Github is a platform that allows you to
  1. **Store your code online**.  (Version Control)
  2. **colabrate** with other people on a project
  3. **Track changes** over time on your code
